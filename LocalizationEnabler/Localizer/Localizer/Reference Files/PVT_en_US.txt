00000.00445=If Discharge Air Temperature Setpoint or Duct Static Pressure Setpoint does not have a change of value within a 24 hour period, then it is assumed that no reset strategy is implemented and the device will be flagged as have “No Reset Strategy”.
    
    If neither point can be found based on the search criteria or neither point has a trend, then the device will be marked as “Undetermined”.
00000.00446=If more than one controller on the entire network has the same BACnet ID, the controller will be included in the duplicate BACnet ID list.
	
	Controllers with duplicate BACnet IDs may cause communication problems when non-Metasys devices are part of the network.
00000.00447=Of the equipment identified as Air Handling Units (AHUs), if the Differential Pressure Switch object value shows "Dirty" or the Differential Pressure Sensor object value shows a pressure drop of greater than user specified limit, then device is considered to have a dirty filter.

If the Differential Pressure Switch object value shows "Clean" and the Differential Pressure Sensor object value shows a pressure drop of lesser than user specified limit, then device is considered to have a clean filter.

If neither of the identified objects can be found based on the search criteria (configured using preference menu), then the equipment is categorized as “Undetermined”.
00000.00448=Of the equipment identified as Air Handling Units (AHUs), if the Economizer Status object value is True when the Outdoor Air Temperature object value is less than the Discharge Air Temperature Set Point object value during a trended 24-hour period, then the equipment will be categorized as “AHUs With Economizer”. 
	
	If the Economizer Status object value is not True when the Outdoor Air Temperature object value is less than the Discharge Air Temperature Set Point object value during a trended 24-hour period, the equipment will be categorized as “AHUs Without Economizer”.
	
	If none of the required objects are found based on the search criteria (configured using the options under the Preference menu) or they do not have trends, the equipment will be categorized as “Undetermined”.
00000.00449=Of the equipment identified as Air Handling Units (AHUs), if the Supply Fan Output object value is always at maximum speed (user specified) for a trended period of 24 hours, then the equipment is categorized as "Fan always running at maximum speed".

00000.00453=Lists objects that are currently in an operator override state. Investigate and release the override if no longer needed to allow Metasys to automate control of that object.
	
	Beginning with Metasys 7.0 the Temporary Operator Override feature was added to prevent objects from remaining overridden for long periods of time.
00000.00454=Of the equipment identified as Air Handling Units (AHUs), if the Mixed Air Damper and Mixed Air Temperature objects are found, or the Outdoor Air Damper object value shows variable modulation between 0% and 100%, then the device is categorized as “AHU Without 100% Outdoor Air”.
    
    If neither Mixed Air objects are found and the Outdoor Air Damper object value shows 2-stage operation (0% or 100%), then the device is categorized as “AHU With 100% Outdoor Air”.
    
    If none of the objects identified above are found based on the search criteria (configured using the options under the Preference menu), the device is categorized as “Undetermined”.
00000.00455=If the Occupancy command object of an equipment has a priority between the user specified priority limits in its priority array, equipment is considered "Scheduled". If no value exists in the priority array between the user specified limit, then the equipment is considered "Unscheduled".

If the Occupancy command object cannot be found based on the user defined search criteria for an equipment, the equipment is considered as "Undetermined".

00000.00712=Helps you save money by limiting energy use during times of peak demand. The Load Rolling feature helps save money by reducing overall energy consumption. The Demand Limiting (DL) portion of DLLR selectively turns off (sheds) equipment (loads), such as fans and lights, or adjusts setpoints to limit energy use during periods of the day that are traditionally high-use, peak times. The Load Rolling (LR) portion acts continuously to maintain a specified energy reduction by shedding non-critical loads. A facility can implement either one or both of these strategies. Figure 1 provides a simple concept drawing of DLLR. The utility company provides the rates, the demand meter measures the demand, and the algorithms in the DLLR object use this information to control the loads.

This scenario is accomplished by turning on the preheating/precooling as late as possible to reach comfort levels prior to occupancy and turning off the heating/cooling as early as possible while maintaining occupied zone comfort until zone vacancy. This object allows you to save energy by coordinating the startup and shutdown times of equipment according to when people occupy certain rooms or areas of the building.
00000.00715=The solar clock object computes Present Value (Night/Day), Sun Position (Azimuth and Elevation), and Sunrise and Sunset times based on the local position (Latitude and Longitude) and local time and time zone information. This information is needed to control external motorized louvers as part of bioclimatic facades for buildings and may also be used to position tracking photovoltaic solar arrays. The Sunrise/Sunset times can be used for external lighting control.
00000.00716=Allows you to view and modify large quantities of similar data in a tabular format. Tailored Summaries transform large data sets into powerful monitoring, configuration management, and diagnostic views. Factory supplied canned summary definition templates (available on the System Configuration Tool [SCT] media) make the creation of Tailored Summaries a snap.
00000.00717=Inserts a user navigation view (also referred to as user view, user-defined navigation tree, and user-defined tree) item into the All Items navigation tree. In online mode, the user view appears as a separate tab in addition to the All Items navigation tree if the user has permission for the user view. In online and offline modes, the user view appears in the User Views folder under the Site in the All Items tree. Assign permissions to user views using the Security Administrator System in the online mode. You cannot assign permissions to user views in the SCT.
